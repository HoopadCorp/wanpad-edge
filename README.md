- This is a System Manager's utility. You **Must** have `root` access to your OS.

- It is recommended to consult [Hoopad](https://github.com/HoopadCorp) technical assistants on the type of the board you choose for the edge devices.

## Install Edge

Login as `root`.

> NOTE: Please just hit `Enter` when you are prompted for a configuration in a pink screen! (linux only)

> NOTE 2: The SSH service will be running on port 24489 after running this script!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HoopadCorp/wanpad-edge.git
git lfs pull
make install
wanpadctl install
```

Wait for the installation to be completed. If there are any errors, feel free to reach out to _issues_ and inform us or call the tech assistans!

### Uninstall

This should be enough:

```sh
make uninstall
```

## Zero-Touch Provisioning

The Zero-Touch Provisioning on WANPAD requires **Token-based** authentication to add your devices to the controller.

You can obtain a token going through the following menus `Configuration > Devices > Device Tokens`.

### Provision your device

```sh
wanpadctl init
```

You'll be prompted to enter your controller URL and access token:

```
Please Provide the following information:
WANPAD controller URI: <URI HERE>
Your access token: <TOKEN HERE>
```

- **URI format**: `controller.wanpad.ir`

After the prompt return, you should be able to access your device through the controller panel.

- **NOTE:** You can also run the script in **non-interactive** mode, doing:

```sh
wanpadctl <URL HERE> <TOKEN HERE>
```
