## Zero-Touch Provisioning

The Zero-Touch Provisioning on WANPAD requires Token-based authentication to add your devices to the controller.

You can obtain a token doing `User Profile > Tokens > add token` and set the permission for the token to `add device`.

### Install Edge Dependencies

~~~
cd /root/
git clone https://github.com/HoopadCorp/wanpad-edge.git
cd ./wanpad-edge/installation/
./install.sh
~~~

Wait for the installation to be completed. If there are any errors, feel free to reach out to _issues_ and inform us or call the tech assistans!

### Provision your device

~~~
./ztp-init.sh
~~~

You'll be prompted to enter your controller URL and access token:

~~~

Please Provide the following information:

WANPAD controller URI: <URL HERE>
Your access token: <TOKEN HERE>
~~~

After the prompt return, you should be able to access your device through the controller panel.

- **NOTE:** You can also run the script in **non-interactive** mode, doing:

~~~
./ztp-init.sh <URL HERE> <TOKEN HERE>
~~~
