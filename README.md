## Zero-Touch Provisioning

The Zero-Touch Provisioning on WANPAD requires **Token-based** authentication to add your devices to the controller.

You can obtain a token going through the following menus `Configuration > Devices > Device Tokens`.

### Install Edge Dependencies

Login with `root`, do not use `sudo`.


> NOTE: Please just hit `Enter` when you are prompted for a configuration in a pink screen !

> NOTE 2: The SSH service will be running on port 24489 after running this script!

~~~
# run `sudo -i` command if you aren't logged in using root user
cd /root/
git clone https://github.com/HoopadCorp/wanpad-edge.git
cd ./wanpad-edge/installation/
./install.sh
~~~
Wait for the installation to be completed. If there are any errors, feel free to reach out to _issues_ and inform us or call the tech assistans!

### Provision your device

~~~
./ztp-init.sh
~~~

You'll be prompted to enter your controller URL and access token:

~~~
Please Provide the following information:
WANPAD controller URI: <URI HERE>
Your access token: <TOKEN HERE>
~~~
- **URI format**: `controller.wanpad.ir`
 
After the prompt return, you should be able to access your device through the controller panel.

- **NOTE:** You can also run the script in **non-interactive** mode, doing:

~~~
./ztp-init.sh <URL HERE> <TOKEN HERE>
~~~
